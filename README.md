# Oracle Database as Graph Database
## Convert sample schema HR into a graph data format

This repository contains a simple SQL script to convert a relational data model into a graph data format. This format, called Oracle Flat File Format, can be used to directly create a Graph in the Oracle Database.
There is a blog post in German (https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/germancommunities/dbacommunity/tipp/7402/index.html) referring to this repository containing more information about how to use the Oracle Database as Graph Database.
