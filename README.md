# Oracle Database as Graph Database
## Convert sample DB schema HR into a graph data format

This repository contains a simple script using SQL and PL/SQL to convert a relational data model into a graph data format. This format, called [*Oracle Flat File Format*](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/spgdg/using-property-graphs-oracle-database.html#GUID-15A4AE0C-2AF6-459B-A3D5-432434ECAD70), can be used to directly create a *Property Graph* in the Oracle Database.
There is [a blog post in German](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/germancommunities/dbacommunity/tipp/7402/index.html) referring to this repository containing more information about how to use the Oracle Database as Graph Database.
